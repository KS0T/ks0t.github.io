<p>I got involved with amateur radio rather late in life, at least compared to 
some people who get into it when they're kids.  I was in my mid-40s, and 
while I'd been curious about it, and known several "hams", I had 
never quite gotten around to doing anything about it.  I wasn't 
entirely sure what I would use it for, and most of the hams I knew
had gotten licensed as young people, and then never used it much.
Even those who kept going with it didn't operate a lot - mainly on 
field days or the like.</p>

<p>I started to reconsider getting licensed when I started to get 
serious about disaster preparedness, however.  Where I live is subject
to considerable seismic activity, and we even have volcanoes nearby,
and the local authorities and folks like the USGS have been warning 
people in the PNW for years to be ready for "the big one" which 
has a small but serious chance of occuring sometime soon. </p>

<p>The likely result of that happening would be very bad - large
parts of my city damaged, no clean water, no food, no power, and 
certainly no internet or phone service, for weeks if not longer.
Given this, I started to plan and learn more, and when it came 
to communications in such a scenario, amateur radio seemed like 
exactly what was needed.</p>

<p>It was shortly after that I ran into an old acquaintance at the 
<a href="https://www.defcon.org">DEFCON hacking conference</a> in 
Las Vegas, and she encouraged me to get licensed. She is part of 
a team that runs license exams at that convention.</p>

<p>I took her up on the challenge, and got my Technician and General
licenses in one go in 2018, and about a year later, got my Extra.
Since then, I've been learning all I can about this huge and 
fascinating hobby, and this site is where I'm sharing my experiences
and experiments. I hope you find something of use to you here.</p>

<p>73,</p>
